      <td>The name ZATRiX comes from who knows where. I'm 15 years old (March 
        7,2002). I enjoy programming, no matter the language. It has been around 
        4 years since I have been introduced to programming. One day I found VB 
        6 installed on my dad's machine so I was curious and tried it out. Then 
        I found a few books in the library plus some that my dad already had, 
        and my adventure began. Up to this day I already know VB 6, HTML, JavaScript***, 
        {VBscript},Pascal,C. Once you learn one language the rest is sooo much 
        easier. Trust me, VB is a great start. Some people may disagree, good 
        I don't care it's just my opinion! Well this is just an example of my 
        newly designed WEB-SERVER. I hope you enjoy it and please do leave comments 
        and rate my project.</td>
